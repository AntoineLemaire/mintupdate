  <title>Update levels</title>

    <p>Updates are given a level indicating how much of an impact they have on the operating system.</p>

    <p>There are 4 levels:</p>

    <table shade="all" frame="all" rules="rows cols">
    <tr>
      <td><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level1.svg" height="40"/></td>
      <td><p>Minimal</p></td>
      <td><p>No impact on the system or other applications.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level2.svg" height="40"/></td>
      <td><p>Normal</p></td>
      <td><p>Default level. Usually low impact on the system.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level3.svg" height="40"/></td>
      <td><p>Large</p></td>
      <td><p>Apply with caution. Impact on multiple applications.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level4.svg" height="40"/></td>
      <td><p>Sensitive</p></td>
      <td><p>Apply one by one. Impact on sensitive parts of the system.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

  <section id="level1">
    <title><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level1.svg" height="40"/> Level 1</title>

    <p>Level 1 updates are updates which only affect their own software and have no impact on the rest of the system.</p>

    <p>They're usually updates for single applications. For instance:</p>

    <list>
        <item><p>The calculator</p></item>
        <item><p>The PDF reader</p></item>
        <item><p>The text editor</p></item>
        <item><p>The media player</p></item>
      </list>

    <p>You can apply these updates without worrying about regressions. In the worst case scenario a regression would only affect the software you're upgrading, not the operating system itself.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="level2">
    <title><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level2.svg" height="40"/> Level 2</title>

    <p>This is the default level, so the vast majority of updates are level 2.</p>

    <p>These updates aren't known to impact large areas or sensitive parts of the system, but they're not guaranteed to only affect their own software either.</p>

    <p>In general, you should be able to apply these updates without worrying about regressions.</p>

    <p>If an important regression, or potential for regression, was found in a level 2 update, its level would be changed to 3 or 4.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="level3">
    <title><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level3.svg" height="40"/> Level 3</title>

    <p>Level 3 updates are updates which not only affect themselves but also have an impact on other applications.</p>

    <p>Typical examples of level 3 updates are GTK, DBUS, etc... A regression in these updates wouldn't stop your computer from booting properly, but it could impact many applications.</p>

    <p>Desktop environments are also level 3 updates. If a critical regression happens in Cinnamon, you might be unable to log in.</p>

    <p>There aren't many level 3 updates. It is recommended to apply them with caution and in isolation. Take note of what updates you are applying, check the system afterwards to make sure everything is working fine.</p>

    <p>If something breaks, seek help on the forums or the chat channel and tell people which update caused the regression and what is broken.</p>

    <note><p>If you blindly apply hundreds of updates and you're unable to pinpoint the problematic one, you're unlikely to find help. All level 3 updates are recommended but you are expected to be cautious and to know what you are upgrading.</p></note>

  </section>

  <section id="level4">
    <title><media type="image" src="figures/mintupdate-level4.svg" height="40"/> Level 4</title>

    <p>Level 4 updates are updates which affect sensitive parts of the operating system such as:</p>

    <list>
        <item><p>The boot sequence</p></item>
        <item><p>The display manager (login screen, session management)</p></item>
        <item><p>The kernel (hardware support)</p></item>
        <item><p>The drivers (networking, NVIDIA/AMD)</p></item>
        <item><p>The display (Xorg, mesa)</p></item>
    </list>

    <p>Like other updates, all level 4 updates are recommended, especially if they are security updates.</p>

    <p>However, if a critical regression was present in one of these updates it could impact a sensitive part of your system.</p>

    <p>You could find yourself without a connection to the Internet, without the ability to start the desktop environment or even without the ability to boot the operating system.</p>

    <p>For this reason you should always be careful when applying level 4 updates (including kernel updates). Apply them one by one and take note of the versions you're applying.</p>

    <p>If something breaks, seek help on the forums or the chat channel and tell people which update caused the regression and what is broken.</p>

    <note><p>If you blindly apply hundreds of updates and you're unable to pinpoint the problematic one, you're unlikely to find help. All level 4 updates are recommended but you are expected to be cautious and to know what you are upgrading.</p></note>
